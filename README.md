# Craps-Game

Rules:

1.If a player throws a 7 or 11 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, the player wins the game.

2.If a player throws a 2, 3 or 12 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, the player loses the game.

3.If a player throws a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 (sum of two dice) on the first roll, s(he) neither wins nor loses but creates a “point.” If this is the case, the player keeps rolling the dice until the point (4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10) is thrown again, and the player wins the game.

4.However, if the player throws a 7 (sum of two dice) before the “point” is thrown, the player loses the game.
